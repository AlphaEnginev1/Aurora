# Increment 11 — Cooperative Director Handoff Production Implementation

## Status

**IMPLEMENTATION PHASE OPEN — first implementation block only.**

Gate 5 contract and deterministic E2E acceptance are merged on canonical `main`.
This phase now implements the cooperative handoff path in production.

## Objective

Provide a durable, explicit handoff operation for an active Director:

1. Director A requests handoff to an explicitly designated successor B.
2. The mission enters a durable handoff/quiescing state.
3. A is prevented from starting new Director-controlled mutations.
4. A completes or leaves recoverable any already-running operation.
5. A releases the mission ownership at its current fencing epoch.
6. B acquires the same mission through `DirectorOwnershipStore`, receiving a strictly higher fencing epoch.
7. B reconstructs the existing durable mission state and continues without re-planning.
8. Stale A mutations remain fenced.
9. Handoff state and transitions are durably traceable.

## Implementation boundary

This first production implementation phase is limited to cooperative Director handoff.

### In scope

- durable handoff record/state;
- explicit successor identity;
- atomic request/quiesce/release boundaries;
- integration with the existing `DirectorOwnershipStore`;
- runtime quiescence checks;
- durable handoff events;
- stale predecessor fencing;
- deterministic production tests derived from the merged Gate 5 E2E.

### Explicitly out of scope

- automatic Director election;
- distributed consensus;
- provider/model failover;
- dashboard controls;
- changes to task-worker lease ownership;
- network/proxy/security changes;
- live-authorization changes;
- re-planning or graph replacement during handoff.

## Required invariants

- One mission remains one durable mission identity.
- Successor must be explicitly designated.
- Handoff cannot silently transfer to an unspecified Director.
- Once quiescing begins, no new Director-controlled mutation may be accepted by A.
- Release must be fenced by A's current owner ID and epoch.
- Successor acquisition must advance the fencing epoch.
- A cannot mutate authoritative mission state after release.
- B must consume the existing durable graph/state.
- Completed work must not be repeated.
- Exactly one terminal mission outcome remains possible.

## Implementation order

1. **Durable handoff store/state machine**
2. **DirectorRuntime request/quiesce/release integration**
3. **Successor acquisition/reconstruction integration**
4. **Production E2E and regression suite**
5. **Canonical merge and verification**

No later block is authorized until the preceding block has passed its deterministic tests.

## Completed block

**Block 1 — Durable handoff store/state machine.**

The durable SQLite handoff record, atomic compare-and-set transitions and append-only lifecycle events are merged on canonical `main`.

## Current block

**Block 2 — DirectorRuntime request/quiesce/release integration.**

The runtime now treats cooperative handoff as a cycle boundary, persists REQUESTED → QUIESCING → RELEASED, releases the current Director fence, and allows only the explicitly designated successor to acquire the same mission at a strictly higher fencing epoch. The successor consumes the existing durable mission graph and the handoff lifecycle is completed without replanning.

The deterministic runtime E2E must pass alongside the existing Director recovery/regression suite before the next block is started.
